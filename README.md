## Book Store app Sheree &amp; Jess

The Book StoreApp will allow a user to search for a book through a (predefined)database and save favorite books into a list that they will also be able to mangage by choosing which books to save, update, read, and remove.

### Technical requirements
* ~~Persist at least four models.~~
* ~~Use Spring Profiles for environment settings.~~
* ~~At least one API endpoint must perform full CRUD create, read, update, and delete actions.~~
* ~~Other API endpoints can perform CRUD based on the business use-case.~~
* Expose CRUD routes that were built using REST conventions.
* ~~Handle exceptions gracefully.~~
* ~~Send appropriate messages back to the client in the event that an exception occurs.~~
* ~~Must have Controller and Service separate.~~
* ~~Document each end-point, such that~~

### Necessary Deliverables
* ~~A Git repository hosted on GitHub.~~
* ~~Around 70 commits (or more) on GitHub, dating back to the very beginning of the project. (Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea of what you changed.)~~
* A README.md file with:
Explanations of the machineries used.
* ~~A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took.~~
* ~~Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome.~~
* ~~A link to your planning documentation for how you broke down this project with deliverables and timelines.~~
* Installation instructions for any dependencies.
* ~~A link to your user stories, ERD diagrams â€” who are your users, what do they want, and why?~~
